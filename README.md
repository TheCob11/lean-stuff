Writing little things (currently just proofs) in Lean4 for learning purposes

Currently includes:
- [Irrationality of the square root of two](Misc/SqrtTwoIrrational.lean)
    - [Irrationality of the nth root of two](Misc/NrtTwoIrrational.lean)
    - [Irrationality of the nth root of a prime](Misc/NrtPrimeIrrational.lean)
- [Infinitude of the primes](Misc/InfPrimes.lean)
- ["Who Killed Lefty"](Misc/WhoKilledLefty.lean): a neat little problem I saw
    - notably includes actual definitions of relevant ideas (not just using Mathlib stuff)
